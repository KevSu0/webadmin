# Application Improvements

This document tracks the major improvements and refactors made to the Camera World application to enhance stability, performance, and scalability.

## 1. Firebase & Authentication Refactor

- **Date**: 2025-08-12
- **Summary**: Overhauled the entire Firebase integration to resolve critical stability and connection issues.
- **Problem**: The original implementation used a fragile, "ultra-minimal" configuration that disabled Firebase's native offline persistence and real-time listeners. This resulted in complex, error-prone manual workarounds for connection handling and session management.
- **Solution**:
    - Re-enabled and correctly configured Firestore's `enableIndexedDbPersistence` for robust offline capabilities.
    - Replaced manual authentication checks with the standard `onAuthStateChanged` listener for real-time, reliable session management.
    - Removed all redundant manual connection checks and retry logic.
    - Configured the application to correctly use the Firebase Emulators during local development.
- **Impact**: Improved application stability, fixed numerous connection and login bugs, and simplified the codebase by aligning with Firebase best practices.

## 2. Performance: Route-Based Code Splitting

- **Date**: 2025-08-12
- **Summary**: Implemented route-based code splitting to dramatically improve initial page load times.
- **Problem**: The entire application was being bundled into a single JavaScript file of over 1.5MB, forcing users to download the code for every page on their first visit.
- **Solution**:
    - Refactored the main router in `App.tsx` to use `React.lazy()` and `React.Suspense`.
    - All page-level components are now dynamically imported, which splits the application code into dozens of smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
- **Impact**: Significantly faster initial page load times, leading to a better user experience and improved performance metrics. The application is now more scalable, as new pages will not increase the initial bundle size.
